# Auto-Loader by SteelMango @ Github
A script to automatically load Helldiver 2 equiptment, to save the time scrolling for the right stratagems and spend your time on Tiktok while your comrades continue to search for theirs.

HellDivers 2 Version: 1.004.001v

## 💻 Dependancies 
```
pip install pydirectinput
```

## 🪜 Steps
1. If your current periperals have a macro function, e.g. Logitech keyboards and mice can assign a button to run a macro, set Auto_Loadoout.v2.exe as the macro.
2. Open Helldivers 2
3. Select a mission and head to the drop pod
4. If host, select a position on the map. If guest, wait for the host to select a place on the map.
5. Once in the loadout menu, press the macro key you set the script to run
6. Done :D!

## ⚠️ Known Issues 
[] Stratagem positioning changes when a new stratagem is added, this means the script needs to adapt to the changes

[] The loadout is pre-set to my currrent loadout, a later version will be added to allow users to set their own loadout

## 🛣️ Roadmap
[] Create a GUI to allow easy implementation

[] Find a way to adapt to stratagem positioning changes (image recognition software?)

[] Change loadout in GUI > save to local >  Create a new EXE
